- fixed segfault if SHLVL did not exist on startup; should cause no further problems(?)
- check missing history
- stop execution on invalid input file
- <invalid cat | cat
- >eins <invalid <TODO cat >zwei ---> eins file is created; error; empty output

failing tests:

..		minishell's output better than bash, I won't change it

cd '/////' 2>/dev/null				2> not implemented

echo ~								~ not implemented
echo " " " """ '''					unclosed quotes
echo $USER$12USER$USER=4$USER12		$1 not implemented
'

unset TES;T		not fixed, semicolon not interpreted
unset -TEST		not fixed, return value 2 for invalid option

where is OLDPWD?
export T+=99								sounds unnecessary?
export -T=99 exit code 1 instead of 2		our export accepts no options?
export TE\ST=99								\ not required by subject

How does Bash:

1 Amount of Commands
2 syntaxcheck for every command
3 Variable expansion
4 Filename expansion
5 builtin or extern?
